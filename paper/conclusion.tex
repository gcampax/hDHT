\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}
We observe that existing running applications are not able to support location-based queries in a distributed environment while maintaining their users' privacy. To this end, we present hDHT, a system that uses a distributed hash table with an efficient routing scheme enabled by Hilbert R-Trees to facilitate such queries. hDHT splits the Hilbert curve into several distinct intervals and assigns repsonsibility for each of the intervals to a node in the DHT. Then users can insert themselves into the system and lookup information about other nodes using routing paths of length $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$. In addition, users' privacy is preserved by limiting the resolution of the R-Tree. We believe this approach will enable novel applications in the future that take advantage of the fast location-based query capabilities of hDHT.
