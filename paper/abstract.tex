Social running applications are currently unable to query and process locations in large-scale, churn-heavy environments while also respecting the privacy of their users. To address this issue we present hDHT, a system that combines a distributed hash table (DHT) with Hilbert R-Trees to enable location-based queries in a distributed setting. By limiting the resolution of the R-Tree, hDHT is able to obfuscate the true locations of users in the system, thus enabling stronger privacy conditions. In this paper we discuss the novel routing strategy of hDHT as well as its C++ implementation.
