The project most similar to hDHT is the Content Addressable Network (CAN) proposed by Ratnasamy, et al~\cite{ratnasamy2001scalable}. The primary difference between CAN and hDHT is that with a dimensionality of 2, CAN gives an average case routing path length of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt n)$ where $n$ is the number of zones, whereas hDHT guarantees a routing path length of $O(\log n)$ as discussed in Section~\ref{section:design}.
