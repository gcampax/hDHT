Now that we have implemented the underlying infrastructure of hDHT, the next step would be to develop an algorithm that could take as input the information about runners' locations and output similar routes. [TODO explain how this would work] Then the logical next step would be to build a more interactive interface so that we could visualize the results of our route similarity algorithm.
